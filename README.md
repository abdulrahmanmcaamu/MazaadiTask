# MazaadiTask ‚Äì Android Home Assignment

This project is an Android application developed as part of a technical assignment.  
It demonstrates the usage of **Jetpack Compose, Clean Architecture, and the MVI pattern** with **Apollo GraphQL** integration.



##  Features

‚Ä¢ List of launches fetched from GraphQL backend  
‚Ä¢ Launch detail screen with full information  
‚Ä¢ Cursor-based pagination (load more on scroll)  
‚Ä¢ Light and Dark theme support  
‚Ä¢ Navigation between list and detail screens  
‚Ä¢ Zero-crash stability with safe state handling  
‚Ä¢ Localization ready (string resources structured)  
‚Ä¢ Release-build configuration enabled


##  Tech Stack

‚Ä¢ Kotlin  
‚Ä¢ Jetpack Compose  
‚Ä¢ MVI Architecture  
‚Ä¢ Clean Architecture  
‚Ä¢ Apollo GraphQL Client  
‚Ä¢ Coroutines + Flow  
‚Ä¢ ViewModel  
‚Ä¢ Navigation Compose  
‚Ä¢ Material 3



##  Architecture Overview

The project follows **Clean Architecture** with three layers:

###  Data Layer
‚Ä¢ Apollo GraphQL API  
‚Ä¢ DTOs  
‚Ä¢ Repository implementation

### Domain Layer
‚Ä¢ Use cases  
‚Ä¢ Domain models

###  Presentation Layer
‚Ä¢ MVI intents  
‚Ä¢ UI state  
‚Ä¢ ViewModels  
‚Ä¢ Jetpack Compose screens

### Ì¥Å Unidirectional Data Flow

Intent ‚Üí ViewModel ‚Üí UseCase ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí GraphQL API  


##  API

GraphQL endpoint used in the app:

https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/graphql

‚Ä¢ Apollo client generates type-safe Kotlin models  
‚Ä¢ Pagination implemented using cursor and hasMore flag



## Testing

The project includes:

‚Ä¢ ViewModel tests  
‚Ä¢ Business logic tests  
‚Ä¢ Pagination logic validation

---

##  Build Types

‚Ä¢ Debug  
‚Ä¢ Release (minify enabled and proguard configured)

---

## Localization Ready

‚Ä¢ All user-visible strings are placed in `strings.xml`  
‚Ä¢ Jetpack Compose uses `stringResource()`

This allows easy addition of multiple languages in the future.

---

## Future Improvements (Optional)

‚Ä¢ Offline mode using Room database  
‚Ä¢ Apollo normalized cache  
‚Ä¢ More Compose UI tests  
‚Ä¢ Skeleton loading animations
